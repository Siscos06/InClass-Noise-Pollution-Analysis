# In-Class Noise Pollution Analysis



This repository includes all the code used to analyze the obtained data using the SPL meter. Being more specific, it includes the following:



##### [***mainCode.m***](https://github.com/Siscos06/InClass-Noise-Pollution-Analysis/blob/ca8339c049234f69217abfdc6dfc3a9e05c8ec0b/mainCode.m)

Body of the code from which all functions are invoked. It includes the data and the definition of all the variables needed.





##### [***distributeData.m***](https://github.com/Siscos06/InClass-Noise-Pollution-Analysis/blob/ca8339c049234f69217abfdc6dfc3a9e05c8ec0b/distributeData.m)

It gets all the data, and depending on the value of *corrected*, it sends specific variables from each case to polt\&calcFunc.m





##### [***plot\&calcFunc.m***](https://github.com/Siscos06/InClass-Noise-Pollution-Analysis/blob/ca8339c049234f69217abfdc6dfc3a9e05c8ec0b/plot%26calcFunc.m)

This function includes all the heavy-lifting parts, where the data is processed and plotted to finally obtain the value of L\_{eq}.
